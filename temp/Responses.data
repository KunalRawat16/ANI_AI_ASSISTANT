Ani: The origin of the name "Tuesday" comes from Old English "Tīwesdæg", which means "Tiw's day". Tiw is the Anglo-Saxon god of war and sky, equivalent to the Norse god Tyr. In ancient Roman culture, Tuesday was known as "Dies Martis", meaning "Day of Mars", as Mars was the Roman god of war. The name "Tuesday" is a translation of the Latin "Dies Martis" into Old English, replacing Mars with the Germanic god Tiw (or Tyr).

User: Calculate this 3 * 9 * 6 * 8 * 4 + 5?.
Ani: To calculate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Multiply 3, 9, 6, 8, and 4:
3 * 9 = 27
27 * 6 = 162
162 * 8 = 1296
1296 * 4 = 5184
2. Add 5 to the result:
5184 + 5 = 5189

So the final result is 5189.
User: Calculate the square of one cos square of 5?.
Ani: To calculate the square of one cosine squared of 5, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Calculate the cosine of 5:
cos(5) = 0.28366219 (approximately)
2. Square the cosine of 5:
(cos(5))^2 = (0.28366219)^2 = 0.08031393 (approximately)
3. Calculate the square of one minus the squared cosine of 5:
(1 - 0.08031393)^2 = (0.91968607)^2 = 0.84648195 (approximately)

So the final result is approximately 0.84648195.
User: Calculate square of oneplus square 2 + square of 3 + √5?.
Ani: To calculate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations:

1. Calculate the square of 1:
(1)^2 = 1
2. Calculate the square of 2:
(2)^2 = 4
3. Calculate the square of 3:
(3)^2 = 9
4. Calculate the square root of 5:
√5 = 2.23606798 (approximately)
5. Add the expressions together:
1 + 4 + 9 + 2.23606798 = 16.23606798
6. Calculate the square of the result:
(16.23606798)^2 = 263.445895 (approximately)
